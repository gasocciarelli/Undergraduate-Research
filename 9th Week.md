I logged back into the database. I tried selecting one of my tables I created, figuring it would give me the same problem I previously had. The same problem occurred, but I found a way out. I decided to randomly hit some keys to see what would happen instead of having to quit and log back in again. In doing so, I hit the Q key and it got me out of that previous problem. 

I decided to create that example table in the document I read to install PostgreSQL on the terminal, again. I previously deleted the table to make room for the new data I was going to install. After creating the example table, there is no problem selecting it. Selecting it gives me the data, then brings me to the next line to give another command. I'm going to try to compare the tables some more to see what could be causing the problem. For now, I do not plan on doing a copy and paste, but we'll see how it goes. 

So I decided to try making a table from the rep information, but chose to eliminate the decimal information when creating the new table. When I removed the decimal parts, commission and rate, the table was created normally. When selecting it, I did not run into the problem I previously did. So now I plan to figure out how to change or replace the decimal parts of the database.
