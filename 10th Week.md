After the meeting on Tuesday, the problems I had with selecting tables from the database seemed to have disappeared. I just tried it today and encountered the same problem with the very first try. After the second attempt, that problem disappeared. I kept trying to create that problem again, but it did not work. The current plan is to just start creating the tables and entering the data and go from there. 

Everything seems to be working fine now. With the original code, it had 'char' and 'decimal' for the type of data that would be entered. I changed both to 'varchar' and 'numeric' and it seems to be working smoothly now. With the exception of the first time I tried selecting the table, everything is fine. Let's see how long this holds up.

I finished up inserting the values into the rep table. Once it was all done, I ran into that problem I had before.

I believe I have ran into what was causing that problem. When I was in terminal, I would not have the window at full screen. When I would select a table that was going to display bigger than the screen was displayed at, it would throw that problem.
