After the meeting on Tuesday, the problems I had with selecting tables from the database seemed to have disappeared. I just tried it today and encountered the same problem with the very first try. After the second attempt, that problem disappeared. I kept trying to create that problem again, but it did not work. The current plan is to just start creating the tables and entering the data and go from there.
