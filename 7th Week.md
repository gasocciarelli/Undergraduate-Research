Thanks to that website Dr. Yu sent me, I was able to get PostgreSQL installed properly. I am now able to get into the system and use SQL commands. There is not a database, however. So there will either have to be a database I can install or I will have to create a brand new database of ficticious information. That website will still have to be used so I know how to log in and out navigate through things until I become more familiar with it. I believe there might be a user name problem when inserting information. I create a table form the example that was used in the instructions I was following, but the information I tried to insert was not registering.
