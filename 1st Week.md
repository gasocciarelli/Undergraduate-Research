1st week:

I started reading the PostgreSQL documentation. I got through the preface, which was rather simple. The preface just discussed a little bit of the history and background of the program, starting from it's conception and how it has evolved from previous versions. I started going through the 1st part entitled "Tutorial" afterwards. The first section, titled "Getting Started", discussed the log in process and username situations, along with actually creating a database. It also went through a few of the basic commands to get through the very beginning. The Tutorial also went through creating tables and how to navigate to a directory, along with retrieving data by using familiar SQL commands. It specified that this is not a complete tutorial of the program, however. I got all the way through the 2nd section of the Tutorial.
