5th week:

I created a new GitHub account that was specific to my YSU email address. My documentation is set up in a README markdown so it is visible in the front page of my repository, along with all of my previous weeks of documentation transfered over to the current one. I tried logging into the Ubuntu server to set up PostgreSQL, but it brought me to that same screen I was at before. I guess I have to change some sort of code in my computer, I believe.
