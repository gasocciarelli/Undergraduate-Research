PostgreSQL Documentation

1st week:

I started reading the PostgreSQL documentation. I got through the preface, which was rather simple. The preface just discussed a little bit of the history and background of the program, starting from it's conception and how it has evolved from previous versions. I started going through the 1st part entitled "Tutorial" afterwards. The first section, titled "Getting Started", discussed the log in process and username situations, along with actually creating a database. It also went through a few of the basic commands to get through the very beginning. The Tutorial also went through creating tables and how to navigate to a directory, along with retrieving data by using familiar SQL commands. It specified that this is not a complete tutorial of the program, however. I got all the way through the 2nd section of the Tutorial.

2nd week:

I tried logging into the Ubuntu server and setting up the password, but there was a page displayed that I wasn't sure about. It specified that the site might be under maintenance, so I'm going ask about it during the meeting on Tuesday. I started going through the 3rd section of the tutorial. A lot of it was talking about making one command and part of code rely on another part before it is completed. The section entitled "Transactions" discussed how to tie everything together to make sure one part of a command could not be completed without the others completing as well. That theme also played a part in updating rows within a table. It explained that you could set it up where someone can't add new information into a row if part of that information does not exist in another table. I ended up finishing the entire tutorial part.

3rd week:

I started reading the 2nd section of the document, entitled "The SQL Language." There's a lot more to this part than the previous sections. The 2nd section starts with Chapter 4, "SQL Syntax." Lexical Structures, 4.1 is the first part of Chapter 4. It went through a lot of the commands that I was familiar with. The part with Unicode was a little confusing, so I had to read that over again a few times. I'm still not completely sure about it. The part about the dollar sign was a useful trick to learn. I was already familiar with commenting in my code, but I haven't had to do that much with SQL. It also started going through operators and special characters.

4th week:

This week, I started reading 4.2, titled Value Expressions. There was even more in this than section than the previous one, with 14 sub sections in this one compared to 6 in the previous one. A good chunk of it was relatively simple to follow along, such as when they discussed array and row constructors. I was also familiar with Expression Evaluation Rules. The sections about Aggregate Expression and Window Function Calls were the most difficult to follow along with. I think I needed more examples to view when they were discussing stuff. Also, part of the problem, or I guess what would make things a little easier, is if they had a universal database they were getting examples from. Sometimes, it is just generic info that is not specific. Other times, it is information from a fictional database, but the databases are never consistent.

5th week: 

I created a new GitHub account that was specific to my YSU email address. My documentation is set up in a README markdown so it is visible in the front page of my repository, along with all of my previous weeks of documentation transfered over to the current one. I tried logging into the Ubuntu server to set up PostgreSQL, but it brought me to that same screen I was at before. I guess I have to change some sort of code in my computer, I believe.
