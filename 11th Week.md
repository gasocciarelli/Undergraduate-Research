So all of the different ways I looked at to instal phppgadmin through Ubuntu seem to imply that I have to install the whole thing over again. I started following the instructions that were listed in a few of them and it did confirm that the whole thing would have to be set up again. That would mean I would have to create and insert the tables and dataset. 

This newest way now wants me to change some stuff as the root. I tried going into the directories that it claims I have with everything that has been set up, but it is not working right now. I believe there might be a problem with Apache2? I'm not entirely sure at this point. Even following all of the steps in order and reading carefully seems to not be working. 

I decided to read a few different step by step command processes of how to install phppgadmin on ubuntu and do a combination of both. The way I'm seeing it, bringing a bunch of them together should help me unbderstand it better.
