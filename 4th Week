4th week:

This week, I started reading 4.2, titled Value Expressions. There was even more in this than section than the previous one, with 14 sub sections in this one compared to 6 in the previous one. A good chunk of it was relatively simple to follow along, such as when they discussed array and row constructors. I was also familiar with Expression Evaluation Rules. The sections about Aggregate Expression and Window Function Calls were the most difficult to follow along with. I think I needed more examples to view when they were discussing stuff. Also, part of the problem, or I guess what would make things a little easier, is if they had a universal database they were getting examples from. Sometimes, it is just generic info that is not specific. Other times, it is information from a fictional database, but the databases are never consistent.
