2nd week:

I tried logging into the Ubuntu server and setting up the password, but there was a page displayed that I wasn't sure about. It specified that the site might be under maintenance, so I'm going ask about it during the meeting on Tuesday. I started going through the 3rd section of the tutorial. A lot of it was talking about making one command and part of code rely on another part before it is completed. The section entitled "Transactions" discussed how to tie everything together to make sure one part of a command could not be completed without the others completing as well. That theme also played a part in updating rows within a table. It explained that you could set it up where someone can't add new information into a row if part of that information does not exist in another table. I ended up finishing the entire tutorial part.
