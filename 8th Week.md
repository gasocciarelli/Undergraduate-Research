I messaged the professor about getting the database to input for the PostgreSQL program. I saw that it required a change of date format. When I ran that command, it did not work.

Changin the format of the date, or datestyle, has become more difficult than I expected. I was using the set command, which I thought would work, but then I read somewhere that the set command is only temporary. I've been checking if the date has changed based on using select current_date.
